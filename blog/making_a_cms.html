                    <h1>Making a CMS</h1>
<p>I was recently watching a video about vibecoding where they said that you really needed to use a model for a year before you got to the point where you could trust it. </p>
<p>Of course, I haven't been vibecoding for a year, but I want to get better at it. </p>
<p>Also, like basically everyone else in my field, I had the idea of making a personal website where I could put information about my work, my work history, and then have a blog that wasn't owned by the corporate overlords. </p>
<p>So I decided to make a CMS for my blog. </p>
<h2>Defining Insanity</h2>
<p>But WHY you might ask? Wordpress is right there!</p>
<p>Sure, it is, but Wordpress has a lot of drama I don't want to deal with. I also want something that is lightweight and simple. </p>
<p>In fact, if I could create something that uses Markdown for writing, that would be perfect. </p>
<p>Yes, I am aware of Hugo. </p>
<p>The problem with Hugo is that it has a lot of templates to configure and I quickly got lost in trying to pick the perfect theme but none of them felt right. So if I can't find the perfect theme, why not try and create something from my own?</p>
<h2>Defying Gravity</h2>
<p>This blog is the output of one snowy afternoon, Google's Antigravity platform, and a lot of coffee. </p>
<p>Antigravity is an IDE that lets you interact with agents (Mostly Gemini 3) and built whatever you prompt. </p>
<p>The tool is actually pretty cool, but every time I've used it in the past I ended up creating proof of concept web apps that I run locally so I wanted to see if I could build something. </p>
<h2>The Process</h2>
<p>I started with the homepage. I wanted something that would be simple, but still show that at my core, I really am embracing the developer mindset.</p>
<p>I also knew that I wanted to use (mostly) HTML and CSS for the front end and then Python for the back end because It was what I was most familiar with. </p>
<p>Once I had something that I liked for the homepage, I moved onto the other main pages. My About page is just a resume (I will be adjusting this later) while my "Work" is still a work in progress because I am not sure how I want to show off stuff there yet. </p>
<h2>Making the Blog</h2>
<p>The blog was the hardest part of this project, but the most fun. I wanted to create a system that would allow me to write in markdown (like now) but then convert everything to a static HTML page AND have a blogroll that users could scroll through that looked like fancy cards. </p>
<p>This is where the python came in. How it works right now is like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I write in markdown in a specific drafts folder. this folder is part of the .gitignore locally so that it won't get shared before I am ready.</li>
<li>When I am ready to publish, I tag the frontmatter with <code>published: True</code> and then run the publish.py script.</li>
<li>The publish script will then convert the markdown to HTML and then move it to the blog folder.</li>
<li>Then, I have another script that will update the blog_posts.js file with the new post. This is how the Blogroll is populated.</li>
<li>Finally, the last script will publish the changes to GitHub which should push my content to Cloudflare where you can see it. This is the last stage I have to verify wish me luck. </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>But Isn't this just reinventing the wheel?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, yes it is. </p>
<p>If I just wanted a website, I could use a CMS like Wordpress or even a static site generator like Hugo. </p>
<p>But I want to learn. I need to be more comfortable with how Agents work so that I know how to instruct them in the future. This isn't Yegge's Gastown, but I am pretty Damn proud of it.</p>
